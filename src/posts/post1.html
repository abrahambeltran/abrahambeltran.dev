        <h1>Milk and Cookies: An Abstract Algebra</h1>
        <p>
            Suppose you're sitting in an electronics class on a Wednesday. Your
            teacher, always eager to retain the attention of the TikTok
            generation, decides to attempt a colorful metaphor.
        </p>
        <p>The subject is electrical power:</p>
        <pre><code>Power = Voltage * Current
  </code></pre>
        <p>So the teacher says:</p>
        <p>
            Imagine their are 2 parties in your neighborhood and we want to know
            their <strong>power</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <u>Party 1:</u> Ten people are sitting around quietly eating
                milk and cookies üò¥
            </li>
            <li>
                <u>Party 2:</u> Two people are losing their minds on meth ü§™
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            And these parties end up having the same <strong>power</strong>,
            that is:
        </p>
        <pre><code>10 * people * (milk + cookies) = 2 * people * meth
  </code></pre>
        <p>
            The class chuckles as their neural-plasticity forms a lifelong bond
            between electrical power, milk, cookies, and meth.
        </p>
        <p>But you wonder:</p>
        <p>
            What happens when you multiply <code>people</code> by
            <code>meth</code>?
        </p>
        <p>So you invent a new algebra.</p>
        <h2>Abstract Algebra: Fields</h2>
        <p>
            A <strong>Field</strong> is like normal math except the numbers are
            <strong>Weird</strong>. But we can still add, subtract, multiply,
            and divide these weird numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can also use cool words like <code>Group</code>,
            <code>Ring</code>, <code>GF(n)</code>, <code>Galois-Fields</code>,
            <code>Extension-Fields</code>, etc to make outsiders confused and
            boost our fragile egos. This part is only required in some special
            groups. ü•Å
        </p>
        <p>
            You can read the real definition
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)">here</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Numbers for GF(7)</h3>
        <p>Here are our weird numbers:</p>
        <pre><code>dead, people, milk, cookies, meth, two, ten
  </code></pre>
        <p>
            Fortunately, 7 elements suggests that we can find an isomorphism to
            <code>GF(7)</code> and we won't have to deal with the polynomials of
            <code>GF(p^k)</code> extension fields (or in other words: we won't
            have to giberish our gibberishy into gibberishum due to the
            gibberish-theorem: hooray!).
        </p>
        <p>
            Naturally, we'll assign <code>"dead" &lt;=&gt; 0</code>,
            <code>"two" &lt;=&gt; 2</code>, and <code>"ten" &lt;=&gt; 10</code>.
            But 10 isn't in <code>GF(7)</code> and instead maps to
            <code>10 - 7 = 3</code>.
        </p>
        <h3>Simplifying our constraint equation</h3>
        <p>Our constraint equation is:</p>
        <pre><code>ten * people * (milk + cookies) = two * people * meth
  </code></pre>
        <p>
            But, <code>people</code> just create problems so let's get rid of
            them:
        </p>
        <pre><code>ten * (milk + cookies) = two * meth
  </code></pre>
        <p>We'll need the to divide by "ten" or multiply by it's inverse:</p>
        <pre><code>inv("ten") = inv(3) = 5  [check: 3*5 = 15 == 1 (mod 7)]
  </code></pre>
        <p>Simplifying further:</p>
